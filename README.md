DS 200 Module 4: Literature Review and Software Tooling.
I have downloaded various datasets from **data.gov.in.** Then using these datasets i have plot three types of plots 1) Bar Plot, 2) Box Plot and 3) Scatter Plot.
I have mentioned my observations. All the plot figures, respective datasets, and python script(.ipynb) file are kept in "DS200 Module 4: Literature Review and Software Tooling.zip" file.

##1. Bar Plot

Dataset :- Number of farmers trained across states of india during period 2017-18 and 2018-19.
Figure **DS200_BarPlot.jpg** shows the corresponding bar plot,plotted between number of Farmers Trained under Sub-Mission on Plant Protection and Plant Quarantine during year 2017-18 and 2018-19 across the states of india.

###Observations:

1. During 2017-18 Maximum number of farmers that were trained belongs to states Madhya Pradesh and Kerala, and Jharkhand was the state where minimum number of farmers were trained.
2. During 2018-19 Maximum number of farmers that were trained belongs to state Kerala, and Jharkhand was the state where minimum number of farmers were trained.
- Conclusion : It is observed that (from bar plot)the growth rate of number of farmers trained was increased in states Andra Pradesh and Maharashtra was maximum which was 100% growth.

##2. Box Plot

Dataset :- Dataset:- Water quality of Medium and Minor rivers in Manipur Mizoram Meghalaya and Tripura in 2008.
Figure **DS200_Boxplot.jpg** shows the water quality of medium and minor rivers in Fours states in year 2008 and minimum dissolved Oxygen in mg/l.

###Observations:

1. Minimum and maximum Oxygen is dessolved in Manipur rivers as compare with all the rivers from all three states.
2. The amount of median Oxygen dessolved in Manipur's rivers are greater than all the river's maximum dessolved oxygen value from different states.

##3. Scatter Plot

Dataset :- Road Accident in Kerala Year-wise
Figure **DS200_scatterplot.jpg** shows the scatter plot between number of road accidents happened in Kerala in different years.

###Observations:

1. We have road accidents data from year 2001 to 2018, init years number of accidents increased exponentially and it will threasholded in year 2005 with maximum number of accidents.
2. After 2005, there was explonential decrement in number of accidents in Kerala till year 2010 with minimum number of accidnets and after 2010 number of accidents again incresed but now the rate is less than as compare to rate in year 2001 to 2005.
